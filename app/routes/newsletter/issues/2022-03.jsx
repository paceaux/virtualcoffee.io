			<h2 className="my-5">ðŸ“† What's happening at Virtual Coffee</h2>

			<h3 className="font-italic">February Recap</h3>
			<p>
				Monthly challenge -&gt;
				<Link to="/monthlychallenges/feb-2022/">All About Pairing!</Link>
			</p>
			<p>
				We spent the month of February forming teams to share ideas and work on
				projects.
			</p>

			<h3 className="mb-3 font-italic">VC Phase Three</h3>
			<p>
				Itâ€™s almost been two years since the first Virtual Coffee happened.
				Weâ€™ve met so many new friends, learned and grew together, and formed
				into the welcoming community we have today.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we move into this third year of Virtual Coffee, the maintainers--with
				the help of a team of invested community members--have made the decision
				to pause new membership while we work on finding the best ways to
				support our existing community and define what the new year will look
				like for us all.
			</p>
			<p>
				Weâ€™re very excited to be going into another year of Virtual Coffee with
				you all, taking on new challenges, and making space for everyone here.
			</p>

			<h3 className="mb-3 font-italic">A new way to join our meetings</h3>
			<p>
				To make our internal events easier to discover and to standardize the
				process to join any Virtual Coffee event, you'll now check the
				announcements for a "Join Now" button before the event. You can also see
				our new and improved
				<Link to="/events">Virtual Coffee Events page</Link> to see what
				official Virtual Coffee and member-led events we have going on every
				week!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>
					**Please note that links from meetingplace will no longer work.

				sharing: Audio/Visual!
			</p>
			<h4 className="mt-4">ðŸ’¡ Maintainer's Q&A â€” March 25th</h4>
