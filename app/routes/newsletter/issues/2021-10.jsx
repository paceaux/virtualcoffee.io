			</h4>
			<p>This month we have three tracks:</p>
			<p>
				Maintainers - They provide issues labeled Hacktoberfest on their
				repository(ies), review the PRs for these issues, and validate and merge
				following the rules of the contest. They also answer the contributors'
				questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Contributors - They find issues labeled Hacktoberfest they want to
				solve. The goal of the contest is to have 4 PRs validated during the
				month of October.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mentors - They will be paired with a mentee (contributor or maintainer).
				They provide support either on Slack, during a 1:1, a pairing session,
				or whatever works best for the team!
			</p>
			<p>
				We also have a #hacktoberfest-co-working-room open in slack for all of
