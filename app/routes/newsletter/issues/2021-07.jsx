			</h4>
			<p>
				This month we're all about demoing in public. The idea is to learn to
				communicate around a project as you demo it, show the finished product
				or parts, gain confidence, and learn to be proud of any progress made.
				We'll be weekly check-ins with designated Demo Days where folks can
				share!
