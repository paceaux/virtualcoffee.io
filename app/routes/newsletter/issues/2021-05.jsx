			<h4 className="mt-4">üí°Monthly Challenge: Month of Feedback!</h4>
			<p>
				We know that being a developer is more than writing code, so this month
				we're working on providing each other with honest and empathetic
				feedback. For the month of May, we're asking members to both ask for
				feedback and to give feedback to others. It could be on a blog post, an
				idea, a coding project, a talk, or whatever you could use feedback on.
				And to go along with our monthly theme, we're also collecting resources
				on how to give good feedback.
			</p>
