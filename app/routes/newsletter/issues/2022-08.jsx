			<h4 className="mt-4">
				üí° Monthly Theme &amp; Challenge:{' '}
				<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/aug-2022">
					Healthy Habits for Happy Devs
				</a>
				!
			</h4>
			<h5>
				This month's challenge is all about nourishing our bodies, minds, and
				spirits so that we can become healthier developers.
			</h5>
			<p>
				Build a new habit that will make you a healthier dev, this can be mind
				and body-centered (drink, move, read, meditate, rearrange your work
				station) or code-centered (review your ReadMe, clean your code, refresh
				your GitHub repo) or both.
			</p>
			<p>
				Set the goal for yourself this month and define what successfully
				completing the challenge looks like. For example, could be something
				like: review the README in 5 of your projects (one every week) or run 2k
				twice a week.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can check out our{' '}
				<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges">
					monthly challenge page
