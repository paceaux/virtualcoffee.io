			<p>
				Monthly challenge -&gt;{' '}
				<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/june-2022">
					All About Feedback!
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				We spent June trying to give meaningful feedback in the community, and
				had a lot of discussions about what it means to give and receive
				critical feedback!
			</p>

			<h3 className="mb-3 font-italic">Volunteering at VC</h3>
			<p>
				Over the last few months we've been trying to improve our documentation
				here at VC. The team continues to work hard prepping for the next phase
				of Virtual Coffee. We have a lot of great things planned and we can't
				wait to open up membership again to an even better, more supportive,
				more inviting community. We are still so grateful to all of you on this
				journey with us and eagerly looking forward to opening up membership
				again! If you're interested in joining the volunteer team, check out

				💡 Monthly Theme &amp; Challenge:{' '}

					Demoing and Building in Public
				</a>
				!
			</h4>
			<h5>
				We're challenging you to do some amazing work and share it with the
				world.
			</h5>
			<p>
				This is the month for sharing your interests with others. Many times, we
				fail to do what we set out to do and let our goals quietly escape us.
				But this month, we're getting ahead of that by summoning our entire
				support squad and sharing our goals, our progress, and our successes.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you've got a project this month, don't keep it to yourself. You can
				write about it, tweet it, make videos, or just share in friendly forums
				and spaces, but dont keep your efforts hidden. The entire community is
				checking in every day!
			</p>
			<p>
				You can check out our{' '}
				<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges">
					monthly challenge page
				</a>{' '}
				for more ideas on how to get started with our empathetic feedback
				challenge.
