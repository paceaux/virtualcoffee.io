			<p>
				Sometimes the best motivation is to get things done, and sometimes the
				best way to get your progress noticed is by communicating it to the
				world! This month, we're building a habit of being vocal about our
				training, tribulations, and triumphs by learning in public. Members are
				encouraged to share progress on their current projects in public forums
				and social media, in the VC slack and daily standups, or both!
