				💡 Monthly Theme &amp; Challenge:{' '}
				<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/may-2022">
					Community Kindness: Let's connect
				</a>
				!
			</h4>
			<h5>Making connections, practicing gratitude, finding commonalities!</h5>
			<p>
				It's never too late to celebrate the community, and yourself in it. This
				month we're focusing especially on doing kind works in the community.
				Whether that means helping someone solve a coding problem, sharing your
				experiences, or just giving thanks for the support.
			</p>
			<p>
				The thing that makes us great isn't the languages we write or the code
				we ship, it's our personalities and how we use our precious time to
				share good moments with each other. So if you've been feeling a sense of
				disconnect, or worry, feel free to use the next few weeks to find joy
				through helping others.
