				I didn't know if anyone would want to hang out for one virtual coffee,

			<p className="lead">
				Thank you all for showing up. Thank you for being a wonderfully

				Spotlighting some of the kindness happening in our community.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					This is exactly what makes VC special in my book - one member helping
					another, and calling on the group when it goes up a level of
					strangeness (as tech so often does). - Ray
				</li>
				<li>
					Just wanted to thank Marie for all her work in the tech study group
					channel and in the community - Lucia
				</li>
				<li>
					Andy bought two copies of De-Coding the Technical Interview Process
					for members of the community. Thanks Andy!
