			<p className="lead">
				We've made it through 100 Coffees, and we're celebrating a full year of
				Virtual Coffee! This month, let's celebrate one of the things that makes
				this community so special: Kindness.
			</p>

			<p className="lead">
				Since this is a special challenge, we have some ideas to start things
				off, but we're looking forward to the creative ways you participate.

			<h2>Theme</h2>
			<p>
				Community Kindness: Celebrating 100+ Coffees, and a year of Virtual
				Coffee Kindness
			</p>

			<h2>Starter Ideas</h2>
			<p>
				We encourage everyone to take care of yourself and participate in a way
				that works for you. If you have the opportunity or time, here are some
				ideas to get things started:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Use #Thanks in slack this month to acknowledge another community
					member's contributions or kindness.
				</li>
				<li>
					Reach out to a new member or member you haven't seen in a while.
				</li>
				<li>
					Highlight your office hours or consider holding a group mentoring
					session.
				</li>
				<li>Share your tips for a skill others struggle with #SkillShare</li>
				<li>Give honest and constructive feedback.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				And remember, a community is only as awesome as its members, and you are
				all awesome ❤️
