			<p className="lead">
				It's amazing to realize that we've made it through more than 200 Coffees
				and more than two years of Virtual Coffee! As we work hard to make sure
				this community continues to be the special and close-knit group that it
				has been during that time, let's celebrate one of the things that
				continually makes this community so special: Kindness.
			</p>

			<p className="lead">
				Since this is a special challenge, we have some ideas to start things
				off, but we're looking forward to the creative ways you participate.
			</p>

			<h2>Theme</h2>
			<p>
				Community Kindness: Celebrating our Community and continuing Virtual
				Coffee Kindness
			</p>

			<h2>Starter Ideas</h2>
			<p>
				We encourage everyone to take care of yourself and participate in a way
				that works for you. If you have the opportunity or time, here are some
				ideas to get things started:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Use the #gratitude channel in slack to thank someone in the community
					you're grateful for.
				</li>
				<li>Reach out to a member you haven't seen in a while.</li>
				<li>
					Highlight your office hours or consider holding a group mentoring
					session.
				</li>
				<li>Share your tips for a skill others struggle with #SkillShare</li>
				<li>Give honest and constructive feedback.</li>
				<li>
					Use another social media platform, like Twitter, to offer gratitude,
					support, or kindness for a community member.
				</li>
				<li>Give honest and constructive feedback.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				And remember, a community is only as awesome as its members, and you are
				all awesome ❤️
