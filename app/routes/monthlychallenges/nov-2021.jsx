				follow links to the November Monthly Challenge!
			</p>

			<h4>What kind of content counts towards the challenge?</h4>

			<p>
				Any tech-related blog posts or articles published in the month of
				November! Feel free to include code samples in your word count totals
				(if it's a word and you wrote it, we'll count it üòä).
			</p>

			<p>

				this challenge.
			</p>

			<h4>What if I don't know what to write about?</h4>
			<p>
				We've got you covered. We hope to continually update{' '}
				<a href="https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/discussions/458">
					this discussion

				throughout the month, but here are some suggestions to get you started:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Hot takes! What gets you passionate? Start there and see what happens.
				</li>
				<li>
					What did you learn this week? One of the best ways to teach is by
					writing about something you just learned!
				</li>
				<li>
					Best Practices. What are some guidelines you've learned that can help
					developers create best practices?
				</li>
				<li>
					Compare and Contast. Have you learned a new language or new approach?
					How does that differ from what you've done in the past?
				</li>
				How to deal with imposter syndrome as a developer?
				<li>
					How deal with burnout when applying for your first developer job?
				</li>
				<li>

				</li>
				<li>
					What was your experience like during the first few months of your
					junior developer job?
				</li>
				<li>
					How did you overcome the fear of building in public? What tips do you
					have for developers who want to start building in public?
				</li>
				<li>
					How to push through with learning how to code when learning was
					difficult at times?
				</li>
				<li>How to start a freelancing career?</li>
				<li>
					Write about a function or a method: What it does, when you should use
					it, and why
				</li>
				<li>
					A time you successfully troubleshot an error: This can be super
					helpful for those who copy/paste an error message
				</li>
				<li>A simple script in your terminal</li>
				<li>
					A customization that saves you time/frustration in your daily workflow
				</li>
				<li>
					Keep a journal of your coding journey and then pull topics from it.
				</li>
				<li>
					Keep a brag board of your successes, or a Time I learned log. Then
					write about one of your favorites.
				</li>
				<li>
					A meta post like how did you chose where you blog, other options your
					were considering before where you're currently set up. Why are you
					blogging? How was the set up process? Features/topics/platforms you're
