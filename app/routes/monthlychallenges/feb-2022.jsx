				Pairing is more than just coding with someone else. Pairing is about
				communication, teaching, learning, positive reinforcements, and growing.
			</p>

			<p className="lead">
				This month, let’s work together to build on these skills. For this
				challenge, let’s try to hit 5 pairing sessions per person, limiting your
				pairing sessions to one Pomodoro session--twenty-five minutes--unless
				you have made arrangements with your partner. When you’ve finished one
				of your sessions, report back to the #monthly-challenge channel in slack
				and let us know how you did and what you worked on! We’ll track how many
				pomodoro sessions we hit. Before you start, take a look at Martin
				Fowler’s article{' '}

			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>To end the month with: 5, 25-minute pomodoro pairing sessions</p>

			<h3>Who can participate?</h3>
			<p>
				Virtual Coffee's goal is to support all developers, no matter where they
				are in their coding journey. We encourage all members to participate.
				This challenge can be done in pairs or as a group.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're not sure how to find someone to pair with, check the
				#monthly-challenge channel on Mondays. Our team will help create random
				pairings if your respond to the pairing post.
			</p>
